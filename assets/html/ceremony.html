<p id="text-ceremony">We are in Olympia in front of the Temple of Hera. <br/>The priestesses are singing odes to the Goddess. <br/>The Olympic Games are about to start and they are praying for her protection. <br/>Later on, the OLYMPIC FLAME will be lit with the fire from the cauldron.<br/>
  Now, the High Priestess holds the lit torch.<br/>This is a symbol of purity, perfection and life.<br/>Before arriving in Tokyo for the next games, there will be an OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY. <br/>In this process citizens from all over the World will be joined by the Olympic Spirit. </p>
