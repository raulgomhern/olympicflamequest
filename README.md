# The Olympic Flame Quest
## Overview

<br/>

The Olympic Flame Quest is a web game addressed to children between 8 and 12 year-old to learn about Olympic values with digital heritage items from Europeana Collections. 

It is based on a map where the player goes around six different cities of Ancient Greece getting the Olympic Flame back to Olympia learning during this journey about ancient history, culture and the history of Olympism.

The game is a friendly way of learning and a powerful tool to develop new skills and work on the Olumpic values such as: the joy of effort in sport, respect for the others, fair play, friendship, the pursuit of excellence and the balance between body, will and mind.
